\title{Latent Structure Optimization Based on Draws}
\usage{
dlso(truth, loss = VI(), estimate = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{truth}{An integer vector of cluster labels for \eqn{n} items
representing the true clustering. Two items are in the same cluster if
their labels are equal. Or, a matrix of \eqn{n} columns where each row is a
clustering.}

\item{loss}{The loss function to use, as indicated by \code{"binder"},
\code{"omARI"}, \code{"VI"}, \code{"NVI"}, \code{"ID"}, \code{"NID"}, or
the result of calling a function with these names. Also supported are
\code{"binder.psm"}, \code{"VI.lb"}, \code{"omARI.approx"}, or the result
of calling a function with these names, in which case \code{x} above can
optionally be a pairwise similarity matrix, i.e., \eqn{n}-by-\eqn{n}
symmetric matrix whose \eqn{(i,j)} element gives the (estimated)
probability that items \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} are in the same subset (i.e.,
cluster) of a partition (i.e., clustering).}

\item{estimate}{An integer vector of cluster labels having the same length as
\code{truth} representing the estimated clustering. Or, a matrix of
\eqn{n} columns where each row is a clustering.}
}
\value{
An integer vector giving the estimated partition, encoded using
cluster labels.
}
\description{
This function provides a partition to summarize a partition distribution
using the draws-based latent structure optimization (DLSO) method, which is
also known as the least-squares clustering method (Dahl 2006). The method
seeks to minimize an estimation criterion by picking the minimizer among the
partitions supplied. The implementation currently supports the minimization
of several partition estimation criteria. For details on these criteria, see
\code{\link{partition.loss}}.
