\title{Compute a Partition Loss Function}
\usage{
binder(partitions, psm)

adjRand(partitions, psm)

VI.lb(partitions, psm)
}
\arguments{
\item{partitions}{An integer matrix of cluster labels, where each row is a
partition given as cluster labels. Two items are in the same subset (i.e.,
cluster) if their labels are equal.}

\item{psm}{A pairwise similarity matrix, i.e., \code{n}-by-\code{n} symmetric
matrix whose \code{(i,j)} element gives the (estimated) probability that
items \code{i} and \code{j} are in the same subset (i.e., cluster) of a
partition (i.e., clustering).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length equal to the number of rows of
  \code{partitions}, where each element gives the value of the loss function.
}
\description{
Based on the supplied pairwise similarity matrix, these functions compute,
for the given partitions, 1. the expectation of the Binder loss
(\code{binder}), 2. the loss associated with the adjusted Rand index,
(\code{adjRand}), and 3. the lower bound of the expectation of the variation
of information loss (\code{VI.lb}).
}
\details{
Note that \code{adjRand} returns the loss associated with the adjusted Rand
index, which is one minus the adjusted Rand index with the expected
clustering.
