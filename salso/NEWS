0.3.0 (2021-12-04)
  * The order of the first two arguments in the partition.loss function (as VI,
    binder, etc.) have been swapped (to be consistent with the paper) and the
    argument names are now much more descriptive.
  * For (generalized) Binder and (generalized) VI losses, let a be in [0,2] and
    b = 2 - a.
  * More accurate elapse timings.
  * Don't use diagonal elements when computing the meanPSM in the summary
    function.

0.2.23 (2021-08-12)
  * Port to use the cargo framework, dropping the dependency on the cargo
    package.
  * Bump all dependencies.

0.2.22 (2021-05-12)
  * Added orderingMethod argument to summary.salso.estimate function.
  * Added showIDs argument to plot function on a salso.summary.
  * Added reference to arXiv paper.
  * Simplified compiling of the source package.
  * Bump all dependencies.

0.2.20 (2021-03-23)
  * Improved compiling of the source package.

0.2.15 (2021-03-10)
  * Added "LinkingTo: cargo" in their DESCRIPTION to use the cargo package
    to manage Cargo, Rust's package manager.
  * Addresses CRAN concerns regarding the use of ~/.cargo and multiple cores.

0.2.5 (2020-11-18)
  * Solved issue when compiling from source using an old version of Rust.
  * In salso function, renamed maxSize to maxNClusters for increased clarity.

0.2.3 (2020-11-09)
  * Bump to version 0.2.x series to reflect major improvements.
  * Refined "salso" function and function arguments to reflect the latest
    version of the SALSO algorithm and simplify its usage.
  * Support for the following loss functions:
        Binder (binder) with potentially unequal weights,
        One Minus Adjusted Rand Index (omARI),
        Variation of Information (VI) with potentially unequal weights,
        Normalized Variation of Information (NVI),
        Information Distance (ID),
        Normalized Information Distance (NID)
  * Partially support the following criteria:
        Approximation of One Minus Adjusted Rand Index (omARI.approx),
        Lower Bound of the Variation of Information (VI.lb),
  * Added "partition.loss" function and well as convenience methods for
    specific loss functions.
  * Added S3 "summary" method for output from the "salso" function and
    S3 "plot" method for output from the "summary" method to produce heatmap,
    dendrogram, and exemplar plots.

0.1.16 (2020-02-07)
  * Added a new stopping rule for the number of permutations.  See the
    'batchSize' argument of the 'salso' function.  To recover the old behavior,
    set 'seconds' to zero and 'batchSize' to the desired number of permutations.
  * Tweaked handling of probability of exploration, i.e. the probability of
    picking the second best micro-optimization (instead of the best).
  * 'salso' function returns more information, including 'probExploration',
    'curtailed', 'batchSize', and 'subsetSizes'.
  * 'maxScans' argument of the 'salso' function defaults to 10 instead of 5.
  * Removed 'parallel' argument to 'dlso' function since it was ignored.
  * Clarifications in DESCRIPTION and INSTALL files, per CRAN requests.

0.1.11 (2020-01-06)
  * Fixed bug related to 'maxSize' argument of the 'salso' function.

0.1.9 (2019-11-28)
  * Improved the algorithm by adding the 'probExploration' argument to the
    'salso' function.
  * Bug fix in implementation of the algorithm.
  * Respect R's random number state for reproducibility.
  * New function: 'enumerate.permutations'

0.1.3 (2019-09-27)
  * New functions: 'dlso', 'confidence', and 'plot.salso.confidence'.
  * Added references in documentation.
  * Updated SystemRequirements and check for sufficiently version of Cargo.
  * When compiling, if suitable Cargo is not found, display INSTALL file.
  * Support compilation on Raspbian.

0.1.2 (2019-09-02)
  * First version available on CRAN.
  * Improved DESCRIPTION file as requested by CRAN.
  * Added \value to .Rd files as requested by CRAN.

0.1.1 (2019-08-30)
  * Support for static libraries.

0.1.0 (2019-08-23)
  * Initial submission to CRAN.
