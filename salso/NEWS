0.2.3 (2020-11-09)
  * Bump to version 0.2.x series to reflect major improvements.
  * Refined "salso" function and function arguments to reflect the latest
    version of the SALSO algorithm and simplify its usage.
  * Support for the following loss functions:
        Binder (binder) with potentially unequal weights,
        One Minus Adjusted Rand Index (omARI),
        Variation of Information (VI) with potentially unequal weights,
        Normalized Variation of Information (NVI),
        Information Distance (ID),
        Normalized Information Distance (NID)
  * Partially support the following criteria:
        Approximation of One Minus Adjusted Rand Index (omARI.approx),
        Lower Bound of the Variation of Information (VI.lb),
  * Added "partition.loss" function and well as convenience methods for
    specific loss functions.
  * Added S3 "summary" method for output from the "salso" function and
    S3 "plot" method for output from the "summary" method to produce heatmap,
    dendrogram, and exemplar plots.

0.1.16 (2020-02-07)
  * Added a new stopping rule for the number of permutations.  See the
    'batchSize' argument of the 'salso' function.  To recover the old behavior,
    set 'seconds' to zero and 'batchSize' to the desired number of permutations.
  * Tweaked handling of probability of exploration, i.e. the probability of
    picking the second best micro-optimization (instead of the best).
  * 'salso' function returns more information, including 'probExploration',
    'curtailed', 'batchSize', and 'subsetSizes'.
  * 'maxScans' argument of the 'salso' function defaults to 10 instead of 5.
  * Removed 'parallel' argument to 'dlso' function since it was ignored.
  * Clarifications in DESCRIPTION and INSTALL files, per CRAN requests.

0.1.11 (2020-01-06)
  * Fixed bug related to 'maxSize' argument of the 'salso' function.

0.1.9 (2019-11-28)
  * Improved the algorithm by adding the 'probExploration' argument to the
    'salso' function.
  * Bug fix in implementation of the algorithm.
  * Respect R's random number state for reproducibility.
  * New function: 'enumerate.permutations'

0.1.3 (2019-09-27)
  * New functions: 'dlso', 'confidence', and 'plot.salso.confidence'.
  * Added references in documentation.
  * Updated SystemRequirements and check for sufficiently version of Cargo.
  * When compiling, if suitable Cargo is not found, display INSTALL file.
  * Support compilation on Raspbian.

0.1.2 (2019-09-02)
  * First version available on CRAN.
  * Improved DESCRIPTION file as requested by CRAN.
  * Added \value to .Rd files as requested by CRAN.

0.1.1 (2019-08-30)
  * Support for static libraries.

0.1.0 (2019-08-23)
  * Initial submission to CRAN.
