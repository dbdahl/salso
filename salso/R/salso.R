#' Sequentially-Allocated Latent Structure Optimization
#'
#' This function provides a point estimate for a partition distribution using
#' the sequentially-allocated latent structure optimization (SALSO) method. The
#' method seeks to minimize the expectation of the Binder loss or the lower
#' bound of the expectation of the variation of information loss. The SALSO
#' method was presented at the workshop "Bayesian Nonparametric Inference:
#' Dependence Structures and their Applications" in Oaxaca, Mexico on December
#' 6, 2017. See
#' <https://www.birs.ca/events/2017/5-day-workshops/17w5060/schedule>.
#'
#' @param psm A pairwise similarity matrix, i.e., \code{n}-by-\code{n} symmetric
#'   matrix whose \code{(i,j)} element gives the (estimated) probability that
#'   items \code{i} and \code{j} are in the same subset (i.e., cluster) of a
#'   partition (i.e., clustering).
#' @param loss Either \code{"VI.lb"} or \code{"binder"}, to indicate the desired
#'   loss function.
#' @param maxSize The maximum number of subsets (i.e, clusters).  The
#'   optimization is constrained to produce solutions whose number of subsets is
#'   no more than the supplied value. If zero, the size is not constrained.
#' @param batchSize The number of permutations to consider per batch (although
#'   the actual number of permutations per batch is a multiple of the number of
#'   cores when \code{parallel=TRUE}). Batches are sequentially performed until
#'   the most recent batch does not lead to a better result. Therefore, at least
#'   two batches are performed (unless the \code{seconds} threshold is
#'   exceeded.)
#' @param seconds A time threshold in seconds after which the function will be
#'   curtailed (with a warning) instead of performing another batch of
#'   permutations. Note that the function could take considerably longer because
#'   the threshold is only checked after each batch is completed.
#' @param maxScans The maximum number of reallocation scans after the initial
#'   allocation. The actual number of scans may be less than \code{maxScans}
#'   since the method stops if the result does not change between scans.
#' @param probExplorationProbAtZero The probability of the point mass at zero
#'   for the spike-and-slab distribution of the probability of exploration, i.e.
#'   the probability of picking the second best micro-optimization (instead of
#'   the best).  This probability is randomly sampled for (and constant within)
#'   each permutation.
#' @param probExplorationShape The shape of the gamma distribution for the slab
#'   in the spike-and-slab distribution of the probability of exploration.
#' @param probExplorationRate The rate of the gamma distribution for the slab in
#'   the spike-and-slab distribution of the probability of exploration.
#' @param parallel Should the search use all CPU cores?
#'
#' @return A list of the following elements: \describe{ \item{estimate}{An
#'   integer vector giving a partition encoded using cluster labels.}
#'   \item{loss}{A character vector equal to the \code{loss} argument.}
#'   \item{expectedLoss}{A numeric vector of length one giving the expected
#'   loss.} \item{nScans}{An integer vector giving the number of scans used to
#'   arrive at the supplied estimate.} \item{probExploration}{The probability of
#'   picking the second best micro-optimization (instead of the best) for the
#'   permutation yielding the supplied estimate.} \item{nPermutations}{An
#'   integer giving the number of permutations actually performed.}
#'   \item{batchSize}{An integer giving the number of permutations per batch.}
#'   \item{curtailed}{A logical indicating whether the search was cut short
#'   because the time exceeded the threshold.}}
