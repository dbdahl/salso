Description: Point estimation for partition distributions using the sequentially-allocated latent structure optimization (SALSO) method to minimize the expectation of the Binder loss or the lower bound of the expectation of the variation of information loss. The SALSO method was presented at the workshop "Bayesian Nonparametric Inference: Dependence Structures and their Applications" in Oaxaca, Mexico on December 6, 2017.
