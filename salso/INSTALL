Compiling this package requires Cargo, the package manager of the Rust
programming language.  This is a compile-time dependency only.  Users of the
binary package do **not** need to have Cargo or Rust installed.  Instructions
for installing Cargo are below.

On macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS,

   - Run the following in the terminal:  curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

   OR, using your operating system's package manager, run one of the following:

   - brew install rust (macOS)
   - sudo apt install cargo (Debian/Ubuntu)
   - sudo dnf install cargo (Fedora/CentOS)

On Windows,

   - Download rustup-init.exe from https://win.rustup.rs
   - In the terminal, run:  rustup-init.exe -y --default-host x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
   - Restart the terminal (so the new terminal picks up changes to your PATH).
   - In a new terminal, run:  rustup target add i686-pc-windows-gnu
   - Restart R (so it picks up changes to your PATH) and install this package.
